## User Journey 4a

A new author is confused at the tagging system of AO3, and goes to my website, where they create a new account by filling out their desired username and password, then logs in with said username and password. Then, they submit a new story by filling out the name, copy and pasting the fic text into a box, and filling out another box of tags they've thought of. Then, they click "submit", and the story shows up in their list of stories. When they click view details on that story, they see suggested tags to add, tags to remove from the author's list of tags, and reasons explaining each choice. They feel more confident in posting their fic because they now know how to tag and understand tagging etiquette.

## Updated User Journey 4b

A new author is confused at the tagging system of AO3, and goes to my website, where they create a new account by filling out their desired username and password, then logs in with said username and password. Then, they submit a new story by filling out the name, copy and pasting the fic text into a box, and filling out another box of tags they've thought of. Then, they click "submit", and the story shows up in their list of stories. When they click view details on that story, they see suggested tags to add, tags to remove from the author's list of tags, and reasons explaining each choice. They write more and update their story, then create a new version, which gives them an updated list of tags. They then delete the version after it does not perform as well as they had hoped, and watch as it is removed from their library. They feel more confident in posting their fic because they now know how to tag and understand tagging etiquette.
