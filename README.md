## User Journey

A new author is confused at the tagging system of AO3, and goes to my website, where they create a new account by filling out their desired username and password, then logs in with said username and password. Then, they submit a new story by filling out the name, copy and pasting the fic text into a box, and filling out another box of tags they've thought of. Then, they click "submit", and the story shows up in their list of stories. When they click view details on that story, they see suggested tags to add, tags to remove from the author's list of tags, and reasons explaining each choice. They feel more confident in posting their fic because they now know how to tag and understand tagging etiquette.
