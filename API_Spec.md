# API Specification: Categorizing Concept

**Purpose:** to categorize a text into specific categories (i.e. a story will be categorized into a set of tags). "Categorizing" can also *remove* tags provided by the author if deemed necessary.

---

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/Categorizing/categorizeFic

**Description:** This action combines the functionality of `keywordGenerator` and `tagCleaner` into a single LLM call for efficiency and consistency, as suggested. It takes a fic's content and existing author tags, and returns both suggested new tags and a list of author tags that should be removed.

**Requirements:**
- The input object must contain `ficId` (the unique identifier for the fic),
- `ficText` (the full text content of the fic), and `authorTags`
- (an string of tags already provided by the author, split with newlines).

**Effects:**
- 1. Uses an LLM to analyze `ficText` and `authorTags`.
- 2. Generates up to 20 highly relevant `suggestedTags` that are not already present in the `authorTags`. Each suggested tag includes its `name`, `type`, and a `reason` for suggestion.
- 3. Identifies `tagsToRemove` from the `authorTags` that are deemed inappropriate, irrelevant, or misleading based on the `ficText`. Each tag to remove includes its `name`, `type`, and a `reason` for removal.
- 4. An entry in the `ficCategories` collection is either created (if one doesn't exist for `ficId`) or updated to store these `suggestedTags` and `tagsToRemove`.
- 5. Returns the generated `suggestedTags` and `tagsToRemove`.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "ficId": "string",
  "ficText": "string",
  "authorTags": "string"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Action):**
```json
{
  "ficId": "string"
}
```

**Error Response Body:**
```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

### POST /api/Categorizing/_viewFicCategory
